Simulated will create randomized stock price movement, starting from 100$ a share.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="front-run--evaluate-quotes">Front Run / Evaluate Quotes:<a class="hash-link" href="#front-run--evaluate-quotes" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>By Default, Trade Unafraid utilizes quotes in evaluating triggers. This is in order to try and give the user a small advantage by getting in early even if no trade has occurred at the trigger price. The idea is that if the quote breaks the price, it is very likely that an ensuing trade will as well. Uncheck this field to disable this front-run feature.</p><p>Example: Let&#x27;s say you have a break price of 100 to go long. If no trade above 100 occurs, but Trade Unafraid receives a quote of bid :99.95- ask: 100.01, the entry will trigger long on the break of 100 by the ask. Similarly, let&#x27;s say you have a candle trail with a low of 99. If no trade below 99 occurs, but Trade Unafraid receives a quote of bid: 98.99-ask:99.01, the exit will trigger on the bid below the low of 99.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="flatten-at-market-close">Flatten at market close:<a class="hash-link" href="#flatten-at-market-close" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>This will flatten the existing trade plan a minute before market closes (around 3:59 for stocks)</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="repeating">Repeating:<a class="hash-link" href="#repeating" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>Will try to repeat the trade plan once it has been completed.</p><p>Ex: Let&#x27;s say you believe that AAPL will bounce at 450 constantly throughout the day. If this is set to true, once your trade plan has completed and the position exited, we will try to play the bounce of 450 again.</p><p>NOTE: We are currently only allowing this setup for setups Break Candle Type and Candle Pattern. We hope to continue to expand this functionality in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="restartsettings">RestartSettings:<a class="hash-link" href="#restartsettings" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="adeactivate-on-restart">a)	Deactivate on restart<a class="hash-link" href="#adeactivate-on-restart" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>a.	When a tradePlan restarts, deactivate the trade plan.

Once a repeating trade plan has run for this many minutes, it will terminate. Please note that this is evaluated at the close of a position for that trade plan. Therefore, if this value is set for 15, and a position is closed 13 minutes into the trade plan&amp;aposs existence, it will still run once more.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="terminate-when-flat">Terminate When Flat:<a class="hash-link" href="#terminate-when-flat" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>This feature is only be available if multiple entry tactic, or a position tactic + an entry tactic is selected</p><p>By default, the trade plan will terminate once the position being traded closes. Unchecking this setting will prevent that. We will wait till all entry and position tactics are hit.</p><p>Ex: Let&#x27;s say a user sets a bounce with scaling in at 449.5 at 450 on AAPL, and the bounce results in an exit tactic at 449.75. By default the system will terminate then. Another example could be bounce at 450, into a market order and candle break, with the candle break being confirmation of the bounce. If the first position from the market order closes, perhaps you will want to wait to buy on a candle break anyways. If this is unchecked, the system will continue waiting until price hits 449.75.</p><p>NOTE: use this with caution, as it will wait for every entry and position tactic to hit, which might occur much later on. It could be smarter to let the trade plan finish, and start another one with bounce at 449.5.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="persist-if-filter-failed">Persist if filter failed:<a class="hash-link" href="#persist-if-filter-failed" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>By default, if a setup fails, either because of validation or because a setup filter fails, the tradePlan will terminate. This attribute will tell the system to hang in limbo, so that you can hit the enter now button if your ok with entering even though validation failed.</p><p>An example of a failed validation would be if you try to trade the break of the previous daily high (with the candle trigger setup), but the price is already above the previous day high.</p><p>An example of a failed setup filter would be if you utilize full time fame continuity, and one of the periods you have selected are not green (if long) or red (if short).</p><p>Instead of terminating the trade plan, it will hang in limbo, and you can manually either enter now, or cancel, as you&#x27;d like.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="setups">Setups:<a class="hash-link" href="#setups" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="orb">Orb:<a class="hash-link" href="#orb" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>This setup is for trying to play an opening range breakout. If you are long, we place a trigger on the break of the first candle high. If short, we place a trigger on the break of the first candle low. The user defines if it is the 5min candles, 15 min candles, etc. This setup specifically watches for the first candle of the day, and never updates after.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="params">params:<a class="hash-link" href="#params" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Candle duration</strong>: If you want to trade ORB based on the first 5 min candle, you would enter &quot;5&quot; in this field.</p><p><strong>Break by</strong>: If you want to give a little bit of space before triggering, set this field. For example, let&#x27;s say the first candle high was 100. If you only want to enter the trade if the stock reaches 100.05, you would set this field to .05.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: validation is applied. If you try and enter an orb setup long, and the stock is already above the first candle high, the trade plan will be cancelled.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="ad-hoc">Ad hoc:<a class="hash-link" href="#ad-hoc" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>This is tactic tells the system to go straight into entry tactics.</p><p>Ex: if you dont want to utilize any of the setups, and would like to buy just on a break of a candle, you would set setup to adhoc, and entry tactic to candleBreak. If you would like to enter now, you can set the setup to Ad hoc, and the entry tactic to market order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="bounce">Bounce:<a class="hash-link" href="#bounce" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Triggers entry tactics on a bounce off a price.</p><p>Ex: If AAPL is currently at 451, we can buy on a bounce at 450. If AAPL is currently at 449, we can short on a bounce at 450.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: we attempt to validate the sensibility of the bounce, by terminating the trade plan if the bounce has already passed. For example, if you try to go long on a bounce at 450 when AAPL is at 449, the trade plan will be cancelled.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="bounce-ema">Bounce EMA:<a class="hash-link" href="#bounce-ema" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>track a series of EMA&#x27;s and triggers entry tactics based on a bounce off the ema. If you are long and current price is 451 and the ema your tracking is 450, it will trigger the entry tactic upon hitting that ema.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="params-1">params:<a class="hash-link" href="#params-1" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>candleDuration</strong>: the length of the minute of the ema you&#x27;d like to track.

If you would like to trade multiple EMA&#x27;s simultaneously, provide the emas in a comma separated list. So if you&#x27;d like to trade both the 8 and 21 5 min ema&#x27;s at once, periods would be 8,21</p><p>NOTE:
1) We apply bounce validation, so that if you setup a long bounce off ema in which current price is below ema price, the trade plan will terminate.
2) For each period you provide, we treat it as a seperate tradeplan. So the completion of the trade plan tracking the 8 ema, doesn&#x27;t mean the 21 ema will cancel.
3) We prevent systems from placing multiple purchases on ema&#x27;s at similar times. So that if, while the 8 ema is attempting to open a position or is in a position, the 21 ema cannot open as well.</p><p>   We calculate the ema based on when the market is open. If you use another platform and have pre market on, you might end up having a different EMA than us, since they might take into account pre market hours.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="break">Break:<a class="hash-link" href="#break" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>   triggers entry tactics on a break through a price.</p><p>   Ex: If AAPL is currently at 449, we can buy on a break of 450.

Whether that means your goal is break the last shooter or the last red candle, this is what this setup hopes to achieve. At the moment, we have only implemented breaking the last red or green candle. If your tradePlan is configured for a long trade, you are attempting to break the high of the candle, if short, you are attempting to break the low of the candle.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="params-3">params:<a class="hash-link" href="#params-3" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>   <strong>CandleType</strong>: The type of candle you would like to trade. Right now, LAST is the only available option, representing trading the last candle of a certain color.</p><p>   <strong>CandleColor</strong>: The color of the candle you would like to trade. Right now, there is red or green. By selecting candleType of LAST and color candle of red, you can configure the setup to look to only trade based on the last red candle.</p><p>   <strong>candleDuration</strong>: the duration of the candle you&#x27;d like to track.</p><p>   <strong>breakBy</strong>: the amount the previous candle high/low needs to be broken by to enter. If long and the previous candle high was 100, and this field is set to .1, it will wait till a break of 100.1 to enter.</p><p>   <strong>filterForToday</strong>: Sometimes, you might enter this tradePlan before a red candle has occurred during the day (say if you enter the tradePlan before the open). Our default behavior will be to look for the last red candle from the day prior, and set a trigger based on that. This filter will ensure that you only set a trigger based on today&#x27;s candles.</p><p>   <strong>Note</strong>:</p><p>   If when you attempt to use this tactic, the current price is above the candle that you are tracking if long, or below the candle if short, the software will know to wait until the next time an appropriate candle occurs. This means you can leave this strategy running all day by unchecking the field &quot;Restart System Once Position Has Flattened&quot;. Additionally, please note that if the trade is cancelled for other reasons, such as a failed option spread when trying to trade, or a failed filter, the trade plan will be terminated.</p><p>   We calculate hours by market open, 9:30 am. If you use another platform and have pre market on, you might end up having a different candle open time than us. For example, if you trade the hour charts and have premarket on on TOS, the hourly candle starts at 9:00 am, since they are calculating since 4 am. As of now, we are always starting from 9:30 am.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="candle-pattern">Candle Pattern:<a class="hash-link" href="#candle-pattern" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>   This setup allows you to watch for a pattern of candles, and trigger if the pattern is achieved. If you want to trade the first inside candle, and then break high, you would tell the software to look for an INSIDE CANDLE, and then a BREAK HIGH. When the break high is hit, the entry tactics will trigger.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="candle-definitions">Candle definitions:<a class="hash-link" href="#candle-definitions" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p>   <strong>INSIDE CANDLE (1)</strong>: A candle in which the high and low are within the previous candle.

If it has a low of less than 99.</p><p>   <strong>BREAK CANDLE (2)</strong>: This is to look for a break of either the high or low of previous candle. This can only be added as the last sequence in a pattern. So for example, you can configure a 1-2, and this will look for an inside candle, and enter the position on either the break of the high or the break of the low of the previous candle</p><p>   <strong>Note</strong>:
1) The first sequence is set to keep retrying until the first sequence is achieved.
2) If the pattern fails, the sequence will be restarted. So if you are looking for a 2d-1-2u setup, and on sequence 2u the pattern fails, we begin again at 2d.
3) There is some &quot;look back&quot; functionality to this setup if a sequence fails. For example, if you are looking for a 2d-1-2u setup, and while you are at sequence &quot;1&quot;, the next candle is a 2d candle instead, the tradePlan will recognize that the 2d was achieved, and keep looking for a &quot;1&quot;.</p><p>We calculate hours by market open, 9:30 am.

If you choose day and click current, you are looking for a break of the current day&#x27;s candle. If you choose weeks and set candles back to 1, you are looking for a break of last week&#x27;s candle.</p><p><strong>candlesBack</strong>: # of candles back to determine which candle you&#x27;d like to have the break occur on. For example, if you select 0 and days, you are looking for a break of today&#x27;s candle. If you select 1 and weeks, you are looking for a break of last week&#x27;s candle. A last example is if you select 2 and months, in which you would look for a break of the candle occurring 2 months ago. If you select minutes, you must choose the previous candle.</p><p><strong>candle duration</strong>: the duration of time unit&#x27;s candle. If you&#x27;d like 15 minute candles, set this to 15. If you want 3 day candles, set this to 3.</p><p><strong>validate candle</strong>: With most tactics, we apply validation to check if the setup is possible. For example, we reject a bounce setup if the price has already passed the bounce price. Or with a candle break entry tactic, we reject the setup if you are long, and price is already above candle high. Here, we provide you the option to choose whether you want to do that. It might be your preference to go right into entry tactics if the current has already passed yesterday&#x27;s low/high.</p><p><strong>breakBy</strong>: the amount the previous candle high/low needs to be broken by to enter. If long and the previous candle high was 100, and this field is set to .1, it will wait till a break of 100.1 to enter.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p><p>If time unit minutes are selected, then the tactic will behave like the entry tactic candleBreak, in that it will update the trigger with each incoming candle. For example, let&#x27;s say you are long and trading 15 minute candles. The first high comes in at 100. If the high is never broken, and the next 15 min candle only has a high of 99.5, the trigger will be adjusted to 99.5.</p><p>We calculate hours by market open, 9:30 am.

It can very disadvantageous to buy well be on a break of 100, because of the length needed to travel to reach that height and the bearish nature of the first candle. We could set candle close pct to 60%, and we would not trigger a long unless the candle closed above 99.6</p><p><strong>Permitted Gap Pct</strong>: Ensure that the open is in the direction that you want the trade to be in. Set the minimum the gap must be. If your gap is .25, then the open must be at least .25% in the direction that your trade will be. If your gap is -.25, then the open must be at least -.25% in the direction that your trade will be. Let&#x27;s say AAPL closes the previous day at 450, and opens the next at 449. Setting permittedGapPct can prevent a buy on a false positive first candle, that reverses quickly after breaking the high.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p><p>We calculate hours by market open, 9:30 am.

If this is checked, it will terminate the tradePlan if the high is not broken. If unchecked, it will sit and wait.</p><p><strong>wait until current candle closes</strong>:</p><p>If this is checked, then we will look for a break of previous candle.

You would leave this uncheck, and when the 9:35-9:36 candle comes in at 9:36, we will look to see if that candle broke the 9:34 candle, and then proceed to the next candle sequence.</p><p>wait until current candle closes <em>checked</em> example:</p><p>Let&#x27;s say it is currently pre-market. You would like to trade a flag based on the 9:30 5min candle, but don&#x27;t want to sit there waiting till 9:36 (if trading 5 minute candles) to enter this system . You would check this field, and once the 9:30 candle completes, it will, with the next candle, look for a break.</p><p><strong>candleDuration</strong>:</p><p>the duration of the candles that you are running this setup on (1min, 5min...)</p><p><strong>breakBy</strong>:</p><p>The amount of leniency provided at the edges of the candles. If try to break a candle, the price to break to achieve this sequence would be high/low +/- breakBy. So if high is 141, low is 139, and breakBy is .1, the price to break for high would be 141.1, for low 138.9. When you are attempting to fail to break the high, it gives more room to not break the high. So if, with the above example, price reached 141.05 and then showed resistance, the candle would achieve the sequence of fail to break high.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p><p>We calculate hours by market open, 9:30 am.

Upon the break of 450.75, we will place a market/work Order. As the following candles come in, the break high trigger will adjust lower.

This is what AddToWinner is supposed to accomplish. This tactic would add to your short as the positions runs lower at user-selected intervals and amounts.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="params-11">params:<a class="hash-link" href="#params-11" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>QuantityBasisValues</strong>: The quantity values, based on what Quantity Basis (dollars/quantity) that should be invested per break prices. For example, Let&#x27;s say you want to cost average, 1000$ per entry, while the stock confirms your thesis, on break prices of 100.25,100.5,100.75. Your QuantityBasis would be dollars, and the QuantityBasisValues would be 1000,1000,1000.</p><p><strong>Break Prices</strong>: The prices you&#x27;d to enter at. Let&#x27;s say you believed strongly on support for AAPL at 450, and that if it broke, it could lead to further movement downward. Every 50 cents, you&#x27;d like to add to your position. Your break prices would be: 449.5,449,448.5.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the break price of 450 included in the &quot;break prices&quot; documentation is not included as one of the &quot;break prices&quot; provided to scaling in. That belongs with the break setup, with its appropriate entry tactic.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="exit-tactics">Exit Tactics:<a class="hash-link" href="#exit-tactics" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="underlying-price-trail">Underlying Price Trail:<a class="hash-link" href="#underlying-price-trail" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>This tactic sets a trail on the underlying stock. As the trade moves in the direction of the tradePlan (long/short), the trail adjusts in that direction.</p><p><strong>Ex</strong>: Let&#x27;s say AAPL is at 449.75, and you want to buy on a break of 450. Once AAPL loses momentum though, you would want to sell it. This tactic could accomplish that goal. You would set a trail of let&#x27;s say 25 cents on AAPL. As the stock continues to go higher, the trail adjusts higher with it, so that if AAPL hits 450.5, the trail, which originally was at around 449.75 (break price of 450-.25), will now adjust to 450.25. Once AAPL hits 450.25, the position would flatten.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The main use of this tactic is if you are trading options, but want to have a trail set on the underlying, and not the position.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="underlying-price-exit">Underlying Price Exit:<a class="hash-link" href="#underlying-price-exit" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Underlying Price Exit is an exit tactic used for adding price targets on the underlying price. In a stock trade, this will simply add orders at the defined price levels. For an option trade, it will place targets on the underlying price that can be modified in the tactic panel after creation or entry.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="parameters-2">Parameters<a class="hash-link" href="#parameters-2" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Price | Pct. per Level</strong>: Each level is defined by a price and percentage pair. The percentage determines what percentage of the current position size should be closed at the defined price level. You must add at least one of these pairs to use this tactic. It is advised that you consult the current underlying price to ensure that all levels are above the current price(below for a short trade).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="underlying-break-pricebreak-price">Underlying Break Price/Break Price:<a class="hash-link" href="#underlying-break-pricebreak-price" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Flattens a trade plan by breaking through a support level. If long, will need to exceed below. If short, will need to exceed above.</p><p><strong>Ex</strong>: You have a position in FB, and the stock is at 300.5. Your candle trail is set for 299, but your pretty confident that on a break of 300 you should flatten. You would enter 300 for this tactic in order to accomplish that.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="params-12">params:<a class="hash-link" href="#params-12" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>prices</strong>: provide a comma separated list of prices (100,99,98). The way the tactic interacts with the parameter is as follows: you provide us a list of potential support prices. At creation of the exits, we find the nearest price below the current price, and set that as price to break. If no prices are possible (ie if long, all support prices are above current price. If short, all prices are below current price), then the tactic is ignored. So if you were trading fb, and provided break prices: 302.5,300,297.5, and the current price is 300.5, 300 will become the break price.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p><p>Ideally, this tactic should be added after the position is taken, and not via the trade plan form, once you know what the current price is. In the above example, it would be quite frustrating if a position exited immediately bc of a support price at 300, and the current price when entering into the position was 300.02.</p><h3
