You can also add or subtract to the position, via pct (the left image), or qty (the right image). With percentage, keep in mind it works the same way as the closing buttons. The percentage is always relative to the total qty bought in the course of this tradeplan. So if you originally had 5 contracts, and you hit 100%, and now had 10 contracts, if you hit 100% again, it will purchase 10 more contracts, and you will now have 20 contracts. video incoming...\n",(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"TPribbon1.png",src:a(9153).Z}),"\n",(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"TPribbon2.png",src:a(2332).Z})),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.screencast.com/t/GppSRdf7rLKz"},"https://www.screencast.com/t/GppSRdf7rLKz")," tutorial on the new buttons"),(0,o.kt)("hr",null),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"1/6/22"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Worked Orders:"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"if the trade is bto, and the % between bid ask was 0%, the limit order would start at the bid."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"if the trade is sto, and the % between bid ask was 0%, the limit order would start at the ask."),(0,o.kt)("hr",null),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"11/25/21"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"tutorial on how to split and separate parameters on entry and exit for work order\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.screencast.com/t/tmFxezY564g"},"https://www.screencast.com/t/tmFxezY564g")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"break by on trigger candle for candle pattern setup tutorial..\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.screencast.com/t/DXWUu5DLcS"},"https://www.screencast.com/t/DXWUu5DLcS")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"manual reactivate long/short on candle trigger setup tutorial (manual unbonking)\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.screencast.com/t/MqLhZj1r"},"https://www.screencast.com/t/MqLhZj1r")),(0,o.kt)("hr",null),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"11/23/21"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"editing candle mag exit in new UI\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.screencast.com/t/AR9izxst1ERZ"},"https://www.screencast.com/t/AR9izxst1ERZ")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'how to "manipulate tu" to be able to trade like you would on another platform. ie enter from an existing chart, manual exits that type of stuff.
