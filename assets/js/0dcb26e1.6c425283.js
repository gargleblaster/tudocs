An extremely powerful part of Trade Unafraid is option management. However, you don't always know what the price of the option will be. It hurts to be stuck taking small 10 cent gains on 5$ options, or hoping for a huge move so your 1$ options make 25$. This would also be an extremely powerful tool in other circumstances that you don't know what the exact qty will be. The way this tactic works is as follows: you provide a target amount of profit you'd like to make per bracket, a stop amount to lose, and the number of brackets you'd like to create. Let's say you are trading long a 5$ option with 5 qty, in other words your cost basis is at 2500.

The thinking is that if you wanted to quickly adjust the stop price, it be much easier to think in terms of how many cents do I want to adjust to, rather than what loss amount will equal a certain price.\n2) the stop cents (relative to previous target price), stays the same as the stop cents that are calculated when we first see the position. As an example, let's say your option position qty of 5 results in a stop cents of 20 in order to hit a 100$ loss, and your first bracket of 2 qty is filled, leaving you with a position with 3 qty. Although a 20 cent move will now only result in a 60$ loss (and a 33 cent move for 100$), we are assuming that you would rather have tighter stops and the simplicity of knowing the stop will be 20 cents every bracket."),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"example"},"Example"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Let's say you open an AAPL long position at 450 with qty of 10. You would like to create resting orders at certain intervals that close as price moves in your favor, and flatten if the position hits the bottom of the bracket.

So let's say we'll define our target as 10 cents per bracket, and our stop is as 20 cents per bracket, and we'd like to sell 1 qty as each target is hit. The tactic will instantly set up ten close orders at ten cent intervals, 450.1, 450.2... all the way up until 451 (in which your position qty of 10 will fill). The first stop is set at 449.8 (450-.2), and with each fill, it is adjusted to the new bottom of the bracket. So when the 450.1 fills, it is adjusted to 449.9.
