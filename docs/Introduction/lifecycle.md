## The Trade Plan Lifecycle
By default, a Trade Plan is active from the time it is created, waiting for a setup to trigger and pass any filters, through the time when its quantity is non-zero, i.e. in a trade, and then terminates once the trade is closed, i.e. quantity returns to zero.  The default behavior of a Trade Plan is to disappear from the screen once it terminates.

There are, however, several properties that can impact this default behavior.
