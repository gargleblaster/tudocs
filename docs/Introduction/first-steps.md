# First Steps

Welcome to Trade Unafraid!

Trade Unafraid is a unique and powerful trading platform. It provides all of the capabilities of any other trading platform that you've used before, but it adds special features on top of that which make you faster, more agile, and more automated.

Trade Unafraid, which we will sometimes refer to as TU, is both a discretionary and algorithmic trading platform, giving the trader the power to automate their trades while preserving the ability to manually override at any time.  

### Setting up your Trade Unafraid Account
After subscribing to Trade Unafraid, you should receive three emails at the email address you provided.

1) an email from **Okta**, an authorization service that keeps your account login convenient and secure.
2) an email from **tradeunafraidsender** notifying you that your server has been created.
3) a payment invoice from **GrooveSell** confirming your subscription payment.

Once you receive the email from Okta, follow the instructions to create your Okta account. This will be your login to your Trade Unafraid server. Once your Okta account is created, follow the link to your personal Trade Unafraid server found in the email from **tradeunafraidsender** to get started!

*You may need to wait up to 30 minutes while we prepare your private server. If you still cannot access your server after 30 minutes, place contact us at support@tradeunafraid.com*

### Tradier Account
Trade Unafraid currently uses Tradier as our exclusive brokerage (we plan to offer support for more brokerages in the future). If you already have a Tradier account, you just need to connect Trade Unafraid to it by granting access to trade on your behalf.

If you don't yet have a Tradier account, you can use the link below to open one and Tradier will deposit $100 into your account if you fund the account with over $5000. Using the link below, you will also receive commission-free stock trading and commission-free options trading for a flat fee of $10 per month (small exchange fees still apply for option contracts).

### Connecting Your Tradier Account

Connecting your Tradier account to Trade Unafriad is easy! When viewing the main TU dashboard, look for the fingerprint icon in the top bar.

Clicking this icon will prompt you to login to your Tradier brokerage account.  Note that you are logging in at Tradier, not Trade Unafraid.  You then grant permission for Trade Unafraid to trade on your behalf through a process called OAuth 2.0.  Once you grant this permission, your account is connected and you are ready to begin trading.
