## Trade Plans
Trade Unafraid is built around the concept of Trade Plans.  The only way to trade is within the context of a Trade Plan.  Trade Plans are comprised of a setup, setup filters, entry tactics, position tactics, and exit tactics.

Trade Plans consist of several obvious details such as symbol, direction, account, etc.  But the interesting building blocks that make Trade Unafraid unique and powerful are these:

* [Setups](/TradePlans/setups)
* [Setup Filters](/TradePlans/setup-filters)
* [Entry Tactics](/TradePlans/entry-tactics)
* [Position Tactics](/TradePlans/position-tactics)
* [Exit tactics](/TradePlans/ExitTactics/exit-tactics)

 It would be very tedious to have to create a complete Trade Plan from scratch every time you wanted to trade, so Trade Unafraid provides two features that shorten that process greatly:

* [User Preferences](/Introduction/user-preferences)
* [Trade Plan Templates](/TradePlanManagement/trade-plan-templates)
