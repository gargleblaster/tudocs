# Underlying Price Exit Tactic

## Overview

The Underlying Price Exit Tactic is an exit tactic used for adding price targets based on the underlying price. In a stock trade, this will simply add orders at the defined price levels. For an option trade, it will place targets on the underlying price that can be modified in the tactic panel after creation or entry.

## Parameters

**Price | Pct. per Level**: Each level is defined by a price and percentage pair. The percentage determines what percentage of the current position size should be closed at the defined price level. You must add at least one of these pairs to use this tactic. It is advised that you consult the current underlying price to ensure that all levels are above the current price (below for a short trade) to prevent an unintended exit.
