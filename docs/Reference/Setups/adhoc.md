# Ad Hoc Setup

## Overview

This setup tells the system to go straight into entry tactics.  It is essentially a setup that has always triggered. 

Ex: if you don't want to utilize any of the setups, and would like to buy just on a break of a candle, you could use the Ad Hoc setup, and use the Candle Break entry tactic. If you would like to enter instantly, you can set the setup to Ad hoc, and the entry tactic to market order.
