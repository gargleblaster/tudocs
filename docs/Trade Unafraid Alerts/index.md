# Trade Unafraid Alerts

[//]: # (I'd like to figure out how to make the Alerts link in the sidebar a single document rather than an expanding folder.)

Trade Unafraid Alerts is a separate product that watches dozens or hundreds of charts, dynamically adjusting as price moves, and is able to alert you via audio, email, and/or text to setups that trigger.

Trade Unafraid Alerts functionality is already embedded into Trade Unafraid.
