# Setup Filters
Setup Filters are used to refine a setup so that a trade is entered only if certain conditions are met.  So a setup may trigger, but if any selected filters do not pass, then that trade will not be taken.  As with other features, the list of Setup Filters will continue to grow over time.

* Price intersects first candle
* EMA intersects first candle
* Time of day
* Full time frame continuity (The Strat)
