# Exit Tactics


Exit tactics are a vital part of crafting a successful trade plan with Trade Unafraid. These tactics define how and under which conditions your trade plan will close your position or a portion of your position. Becoming familiar with each of these tactics will prove invaluable in your journey as a successful trader using the Trade Unafraid platform. Below you will find a detailed explanation of each tactic along with some helpful examples.

To add a tactic to your trade plan, select it from the dropdown and push the **add** button to add it to the trade plan. A tactic is active if it is visible in the trade plan form; to remove the tactic, simply click on the red **x** in the top right corner. A trade plan can have multiple exit tactics, and they will all function independently. Even though the combination of all exit tactics may account for many times the actual quantity of your position, the orders will execute as they occur, and the remaining tactics will adjust to the new position quantity.  This is part of the magic of Trade Unafraid.
