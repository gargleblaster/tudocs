# Setups
The list of setups available in Trade Unafraid continues to grow to meet users' needs.

### Bounce
Enter a price where you expect the stock to bounce, i.e. reverse direction.  The direction of the trade matters here.  If the current price is 99, and you enter 100 as the bounce price, then your trade plan must be configured to go short.  If it were expected to go long, then it would make no sense for price to bounce at 100 from below.
